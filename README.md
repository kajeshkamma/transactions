# TransactionAnalyser
To display statistic information about processed transactions

## Requirement
The goal of the system is to display statistic information about processed transactions.
A transaction record will contain the following fields:
ID - A String representing the transaction id
Date - The date and time when the transaction took place (format "DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm:ss")
Amount - The value of the transaction (dollars and cents)
Merchant - The name of the merchant this transaction belongs to
Type - The type of the transaction, which could be either PAYMENT or REVERSAL
Related Transaction - (Optional) - In the case a REVERSAL transaction, this field will contain the id of the transaction it is reversing.

The system will be initialized with an input file in CSV format containing a list of transaction records. ( org.deb.loader.CSVLoaderImpl )

Once initialized, the system should report the total number of transactions and the average transaction value for a specific merchant in a specific date range.
Another requirement is that, if a transaction has a reversing transaction, then it should not be included in the computed statistics, even if the reversing transaction is outside of the requested date range. ( org.deb.analysis.Analysis )

### Assumptions
For the sake of simplicity, you can assume that Transaction records are listed in correct time order.
The input file is well formed and is not missing data.


## How to build
```
mvn clean install 
```

## How to run
```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.deb.App"
```

or execute
./run.sh

### Main Classes
* org.deb.loader.impl.CSVLoaderImpl - loadTransactions method returns all PAYMENT transactions which are without any REVERSAL from csv file.

* org.deb.analysis.Analysis - Analyze transactions.


### 3rd party libraries
* opencsv - to read CSV files.
* org.openjdk.jmh - to do micro benchmark.

### How to run benchmark
java -jar target/benchmarks.jar
